# Emotional_fool

Welcome to the Repository of Emotional Fool. This Repository was created in the HackFest 2022. 
Here you will see 2 .ipynb files:
#### 1. Emotion Classification:
This file uses a DenseNet169, imported using torch.nn.application for fitting the data.
#### 2. emotional-fool 
This file goes one step ahead and trains a ResNet for Emotion Classification and then uses OpenCV Haarcacade pretrained model to detect the persons' faces and then makes classification on it. This was for submission in hackfest 2023. 

The Dataset used in both of these was more or less same. 
Hope you enjoy this repo.
